-- Declare a new module
-- Now other modules in the project can import this one like so:
-- import PhotoGroove exposing (main)
-- We'e only exposing `main` for use in other modules
-- This means other modules can't import `model` from here, for example
-- In general, it's best to expose as little as possible!


module PhotoGroove exposing (main)

-- Import other modules
-- We're exposing *all* exports from `Html` into the global scope
-- This is how we can call functions like `div` without needing to prepend
-- it with `Html.`
-- In this case, exposing everything from Html and Html.Atributes is fine,
-- but it's best to try to be as specific as possible with your imports to
-- prevent name ambiguity and confusion

import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Attributes exposing (..)
