-- Declare a new module
-- Now other modules in the project can import this one like so:
-- import PhotoGroove exposing (main)
-- We'e only exposing `main` for use in other modules
-- This means other modules can't import `model` from here, for example
-- In general, it's best to expose as little as possible!


module PhotoGroove exposing (main)

-- Import other modules
-- We're exposing *all* exports from `Html` into the global scope
-- This is how we can call functions like `div` without needing to prepend
-- it with `Html.`
-- In this case, exposing everything from Html and Html.Atributes is fine,
-- but it's best to try to be as specific as possible with your imports to
-- prevent name ambiguity and confusion

-- Below, `Array.get` returns a `Maybe a`, which is essentially a container

-- custom type variant, which means it can be destructured like a tuple!
-- Below we destructure Just and name its contained value `photo`
-- In English, the Just branch says the following: "This branch matches a Maybe
-- value that was created using the Just variant. Extract that value that was
-- passed to Just and name it photo"

-- Messages are fed into the update function to produce new models
-- After an update, the new model is sent to the view function to determine
-- the new DOM
-- Msg is a custom type with four variants
-- All of the variants are containers that hold different types of values

-- For example, ClickedPhoto is of type `String -> Msg`
-- That is, except for ClickedSurpriseMe
-- It simply *is* an instance of Msg

-- It takes as its first arg the Msg to pass to update
-- It takes as its second arg a function that returns the value to pass to
-- the Msg (in this case the Int supplied to GotSelectedIndex) given that the
-- Msg should hold a value (see comments right above)

-- Browser.element wires together your state, how the page should look
-- depending on the state, and how changes can be made to the state
-- The init function takes flags as an arg and returns a tuple containing
-- 1) the initial state and 2) a command to run when the app loads
-- Since we don't need to do anything when the app loads, we passed Cmd.none
-- The () in the type annotation is called a unit
-- It contains no info whatsoever, but it's both a value and a type
-- The () type can only be satisfied witht the () value
-- As such, a function that takes *only* () only accepts one input and
-- only returns one output
-- Below, the () represents our flags type, which we aren't using right now
-- Using () for our flags type indicates that we don't accept any flags!
-- The `Model` means the type of our model is our custom type `Model`
-- The `Msg` means that the type of message our update and view functions will
-- use is our custom type `Msg`
-- Putting all these together, we can  read the below type annotation as "an
-- Elm program with no flags, whose model type is Model and whose message type
-- is Msg"
-- It's kinda like making an arrow function that takes no args in JS?
