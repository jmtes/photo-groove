-- Declare a new module
-- Now other modules in the project can import this one like so:
-- import PhotoGroove exposing (main)
-- We'e only exposing `main` for use in other modules
-- This means other modules can't import `model` from here, for example
-- In general, it's best to expose as little as possible!


module PhotoGroove exposing (main)

-- Import other modules
-- By specifying which values we're exposing from Html, we can call `div`, etc.
-- without having to prefix it with `Html.`
-- We're exposing *all* exports from `Html.Attributes` into the global scope
-- This is how we can call functions like `class` without needing to prepend
-- it with `HtmlAttributes.`

import Html exposing (div, h1, img, text)
import Html.Attributes exposing (..)


view model =
    div [ class "content" ]
        [ h1 [] [ text "Photo Groove" ]
        , div [ id "thumbnails" ]
            [ img [ src "http://elm-in-action.com/1.jpeg" ] []
            , img [ src "http://elm-in-action.com/2.jpeg" ] []
            , img [ src "http://elm-in-action.com/3.jpeg" ] []
            ]
        ]


main =
    view "no model yet"
