-- Declare a new module
-- Now other modules in the project can import this one like so:
-- import PhotoGroove exposing (main)
-- We'e only exposing `main` for use in other modules
-- This means other modules can't import `model` from here, for example
-- In general, it's best to expose as little as possible!
-- Since we're using ports, we have to say `port module` instead of just
-- `module`


port module PhotoGroove exposing (main)

-- Import other modules
-- We're exposing *all* exports from `Html` into the global scope
-- This is how we can call functions like `div` without needing to prepend
-- it with `Html.`
-- In this case, exposing everything from Html and Html.Atributes is fine,
-- but it's best to try to be as specific as possible with your imports to
-- prevent name ambiguity and confusion

-- View function takes a model and returns a list of Html nodes
-- User events such as clicks are translated into message values
-- For reference, the <| acts like an opening parenthesis except it doesn't
-- need a closer
-- Both these lines do the same thing:
-- String.toUpper (String.reverse "hello")
-- String.toUpper <| String.reverse "hello"
-- It's just that the latter looks a lot nicer
-- Note: It's generally a good idea to keep our types as narrow as possible,
-- so we'd like to avoid passing `viewLoaded` the entire `Model` if we can
-- That's not a refactor we need to do right now, though

-- Contrary to what the name suggests, we're not actually using Encode to

-- in this case an int
-- If we had used Encode.string (String.fromInt magnitude) instead, the

-- Below we're declaring a function called `setFilters` that takes in
-- FilterOptions and returs a Cmd msg
-- We don't write an implementation for this function because the `port`
-- keyword does it for us, all it needs is the type
-- All port functions that send data to JS follow this pattern:
-- 1. The port keyword is followed by a function name and type annotation
-- 2. The type annotation must be for a function that takes one arg
-- 3. The function MUST return a `Cmd msg`, nothing else
-- Not even a `Cmd Msg`!
-- A `Cmd msg` by itself like this is a command that produces no message after
-- it completes
-- As such, both `Cmd.none` and `setFilters` produce no message after
-- completing
-- The difference is that Cmd.none has no effects, while setFilters performs
-- the effect of sending data to JS (specifically, it will send the
-- filterOptions data we pass to it)
-- You can think of setFilters as a "fire and forget" command
-- Note: Although HTTP requests can fail, sending data to JS cannot
-- We don't miss out on any error-handling opportunities just because
-- setFilters sends no message back to `update`


port setFilters : FilterOptions -> Cmd msg



-- This is the data we're going to send to JS
-- In order to apply filters, the JS library we're going to use needs the

-- Below, `succeed Photo` begins the pipeline
-- It says our decoder will decode the arguments to Photo one by one
-- Ultimately the whole decoder will succeed unless any steps in the pipeline
-- fails
-- Because Photo accepts 3 arguments, we'll need 3 pipeline steps or else the
-- compiler will give us an error
-- `required "url" string` says that what we're decoding has to be JSON object
-- with a field "url" containing a string
-- Decoding could fail at this step either because the "url" field is missing
-- or it's present but not a string value
-- `optional "title" string "Untitled"` says that if the "title" field is
-- missing or null, we'll default to it being "Untitled" when we build the
-- Photo
-- The decoder type returned from each step in the pipeline must match the
-- corresponding arg in the succeed function
-- In this example, because Photo takes a String as its first arg, the first
-- step in the pipeline has to return a decoder containing a String

-- Messages are fed into the update function to produce new models

-- Msg is a custom type with four variants
-- All of the variants are containers that hold different types of values

-- For example, ClickedPhoto is of type `String -> Msg`
-- That is, except for ClickedSurpriseMe
-- It simply *is* an instance of Msg

-- Below, Random.generate is a Cmd
-- It takes as its first arg the Msg to pass to update
-- It takes as its second arg a function that returns the value to pass to
-- the Msg (in this case the Int supplied to GotSelectedIndex) given that the
-- Msg should hold a value (see comments right above)
-- In the (firstPhoto :: otherPhotos) expression below, we're essentialy
-- saying "Give me the first photo and then a list of the other photos"
-- So the type of firstPhoto would be Photo, while that of otherPhotos would
-- be List Photo
-- Whenever you encounter a function like Random.uniform that takes a non
-- empty list, using the :: pattern in a case expression is often a good way
-- to obtain the arguments it needs
-- When using pipelines, the order of the functions from top-down is pretty
-- much the reverse of what it'd be with parentheses
-- In the GotPhotos branch, what `(firstUrl :: _) as urls` means is:
-- "Give the name `urls` to the entire List, while also subdividing it into
-- its first element, which we will name `firstUrl`, and its remaining
-- elements, which we will decline to name because we won't use them"
-- `as` can also be used to destructure function arguments, i.e:
-- doSomethingWithTuple ((first, second) as tuple) = ...
-- doSomethingWithRecord ({username, password} as user) = ...
